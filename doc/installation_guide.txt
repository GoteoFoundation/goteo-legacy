INSTALLATION GUIDE
==================

Have a server with:
	- Apache 2.2 ( with mod_rewrite )
	- PHP 5.3	 ( ensure you can see phpinfo() )
	- MySql 5.5  ( ensure you can create and manage a database )

Prepare a htdocs folder on your server that can be accessed with a browser. Maybe you have to modify the virtualhost file on your server.

Uncompress source files from github into that folder (you dont need to have the /db and /doc folders published)

Execute the scripts on the `db` folder. goteo.sql first then the others. Not mention you have to create the database and a user for it.
IMPORTANT: better to replace SiteName and SiteMail with your site name/mail BEFORE execute the script texts.sql
Note that you have to write your own terms and privacy pages, those contents are empty at pages.sql

On the first run you will see a settings file example, copy it into a file called `local-settings.php`.
Modify it with database credentials:
	 GOTEO_DB_SCHEMA is the name of your database
	 GOTEO_DB_USERNAME is the user you created for your database
	 GOTEO_DB_PASSWORD is the password you setted for that user

Modify the access point to the site
	 SITE_URL is 'http://your.intallation.site'
	 SRC_URL is (for you and now) the same 'http://your.intallation.site'
* If you're installing on localhost you have to create a hosts entry for this

Every thing should be working fine at http://your.intallation.site 
* check that you have the .htaccess file (if downloaded the zip maybe not extracted) https://github.com/Goteo/Goteo/blob/master/.htaccess

	
Set the email and pasword for the goteo root user with the following SQL sentence:
	UPDATE user SET password = SHA1('yourpassword') AND email = 'youremail' WHERE id = 'root';

Log in with that root user and manage the contents at http://your.intallation.site/admin
	
If you want to modify the code for your own purposses, better you read /doc/plataforma_goteo.doc (english version in progress)
Also remember that you have to license the modified source code.

We'll be thankful if you notify us about your implementation.
