INSTALLATION GUIDE
==================

Have a server with:
	- Apache 2.2 ( with mod_rewrite )
	- PHP 5.3	 ( ensure you can see phpinfo() )
	- MySql 5.5  ( ensure you can create and manage a database )

Prepare a htdocs folder on your server that can be accessed with a browser. Maybe you have to modify the virtualhost file on your server.

Uncompress source files from github into that folder (you dont need to have the /db and /doc folders published)

Execute the /db/goteo.sql script on the database, then the /db/pages.sql 

Modify /config.php file with database credentials:
	 GOTEO_DB_SCHEMA is the name of your database
	 GOTEO_DB_USERNAME is the user you created for your database
	 GOTEO_DB_PASSWORD is the password you setted for that user

Set the email and pasword for the goteo root user with the following SQL sentence:
	UPDATE user SET password = SHA1('yourpassword') AND email = 'youremail' WHERE id = 'root';

Modify /config.php file with the access point to the htdocs folder
	 SITE_URL is 'http://your.intallation.site'
	 SRC_URL is (for you and now) the same 'http://your.intallation.site'

Every thing should be working fine at http://your.intallation.site 

You manage the contents at http://your.intallation.site/admin
	
If you want to modify the code for your own purposses, better you read /doc/plataforma_goteo.doc (it's in spanish, apologies)
